Maze Generator that generates a different maze everytime the page is refereshed, with the help of Matter.js. To move through the maze, make sure to use the 'WASD' keys. Also tap the keys instead of holding them, if they're held down the ball will gain enough velocity to go through walls and break the functionality.
